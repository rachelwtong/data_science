## Data Science Portfolio 

This repository contains my personal data science projects. It currently contains the following projects: 

1. Spotify Library of Music Analysis
2. Rachel's Spotify Data Analysis
3. Prediction Hotel Cancellations (DataCamp Competition)
4. Understanding the World's Access to Internet (DataCamp Project)

Datasets used for the projects are included in the data folder. The 'tracks 2021.csv' file used in the 'Spotify Library of Music Analysis' is in a compressed file format due to size and will need to be downloaded for use.
